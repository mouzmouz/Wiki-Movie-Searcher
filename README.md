**Minimal++ Compiler**

This project implements a compiler for the Minimal++ programming language and was programmed for Computer Science & Engineering @UoI. The compiler is structured in three main phases:

* Lexical Analysis: The program reads the source code character by character, identifying keywords, symbols, and identifiers
* Syntax Analysis: Using recursive descent parsing, the compiler checks if the code follows the grammar of Minimal++
* Intermediate and Final Code Generation: The intermediate code is represented as quadruples, and the final code is generated in MIPS assembly

The compiler includes a symbol table, handles nested functions and scopes, and outputs both intermediate code and executable assembly code. The project is tested with various programs that run successfully in the MARS simulator.
